After voting is completed, users can get their voting receipt. 
In the voting receipt, users get their details as well as the candidate they voted for in their constituency. 
All data entered by the voter is saved in the MySQL database, and each voter can vote only once.

This are the details of the party and their candidates.![Screenshot 2024-06-26 170606](https://github.com/Sun-shINe-arch/Voting-System/assets/40921219/760ca178-7a56-4ad1-8044-eee666b2fe7c)
