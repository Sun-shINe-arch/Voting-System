It is a project based on a voting system for an election. 
The project consists of voter ID creation for candidates who are going to vote in their constituency. 
After creating their voter ID, users can also print their voter ID. 
The first frame of the project contains 4 buttons: Voter ID creation, VOTE, Voting Receipt, and Cancel.

If a voter wants to vote, they have to enter their voter ID and password. 
Then, the list of available parties is shown. After voting is completed, users can get their voting receipt. 
In the voting receipt, users get their details as well as the candidate they voted for in their constituency. 
All data entered by the voter is saved in the MySQL database, and each voter can vote only once.
